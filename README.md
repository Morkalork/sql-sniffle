# sql-sniffle
SQL Sniffle will contain useful scripts I have created to help me conquer and domesticate SQL-Server. The first
script added was **SQL Row Creator** which I created because I had to add rows into huge tables and I wanted
a quick way to handle it.

**On a side note...**
I only chose this name because GitHub suggested 'supreme-sniffle' which wasn't really advertising the SQL part of this project...
